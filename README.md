# Neural-Networks
[![Python 2.7][python-img]][python-url]
## About
This is just a repository to host some of the tests that I am doing with neural
networks. I hope to incorporate pattern guessing, handwriting recognition, and
more.
## How to Run
Before running install dependencies using the text file and pip command:
```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then run the program:
```bash
$ python run.py
```
## Options
Currently there are two options `-v` and `-i` for verbose and amount of iterations,
respectively. Verbose prints more in depth values of the process. Defining iterations will
change how many iterations of training the network will go through. If you
forget the options `-h` will give descriptions.
