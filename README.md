# Neural-Networks
## About
This is just a repository to host some of the tests that I am doing with neural
networks. I hope to incorporate pattern guessing, handwriting recognition, and
more.
## How to Run
To run, first install numpy:
```bash
$ pip install numpy
```
Then run the program:
```bash
$ python network.py
```
